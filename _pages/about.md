Hi everyone! My name is Heejae (조희재/曹僖材), a 2nd year student at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.linkedin.com/school/hkust/posts/?feedView=all), currently studying towards a BSc in Mathematics, with a focus on Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence applications.

I spend my free time towards building projects that enhance my skills and understanding of several fundamental topics in Mathematics, Data Science, Deep Learning, and Quantitative Trading.

Outside of this, I enjoy several hobbies like jogging, hiking, reading books, and visual art!

Feel free to explore this website, and to contact me through the links below! Thanks!
