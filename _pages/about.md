Hi everyone! My name is Heejae (조희재/曹僖材), a Year 1 student at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.linkedin.com/school/hkust/posts/?feedView=all). 



I often spend my free time towards building projects that enhance my skills and understanding of several fundamental topics in Mathematics, Data Science, Deep Learning, and Quantitative Trading. Additionally, I am currently working towards earning my first AWS certification this year. 

Outside of this, I enjoy several hobbies like jogging, hiking, reading books, and artistic illustration!

Feel free to explore this website, and to contact me through the links below! Thanks!
